# Product Evaluation Rubric

Use this rubric to critically evaluate product ideas across four dimensions. For each dimension, identify specific gaps, assumptions, and required evidence.

## 1. Value (Will customers buy it / users choose to use it?)

**Key Questions:**
- Does this solve a meaningful problem or create a valuable opportunity?
- Is the customer benefit clear and compelling?
- How much better is this than current alternatives (10x? 2x? 10%)?
- What's the willingness to pay or adopt?

**Red Flags:**
- Vague or generic value proposition
- "Nice to have" vs "must have"
- Assumes customers want a solution without evidence
- Benefits are incremental when market demands transformation

**Evidence Needed:**
- Customer interviews showing pain severity and frequency
- Data on current workarounds or spend
- Win/loss analysis or competitive displacement data
- Usage metrics from prototypes or analogous products

## 2. Usability (Can users figure out how to use it?)

**Key Questions:**
- Can the primary customer accomplish the core task without help?
- What's the learning curve for someone new?
- How error-prone is the experience?
- Does it fit naturally into existing workflows?

**Red Flags:**
- Requires extensive training or documentation
- Success depends on "power users"
- Multiple steps where one would do
- Jargon or concepts unfamiliar to target users

**Evidence Needed:**
- Prototype testing with target users (task completion rate, time, errors)
- Observational studies of current workflow
- Comparison to usability benchmarks in category
- Support ticket analysis from similar products

## 3. Feasibility (Can we build it with current resources?)

**Key Questions:**
- Do we have the technical skills and tools required?
- Are there known technical risks or unknowns?
- What's the realistic timeline given team and constraints?
- Are there dependencies on third parties or immature tech?

**Red Flags:**
- Core tech is unproven or requires R&D
- Tight coupling to unreliable external systems
- Team lacks domain expertise
- Timeline assumes best-case scenarios throughout

**Evidence Needed:**
- Technical spike or proof-of-concept results
- Team assessment of skill gaps
- Dependency mapping and risk analysis
- Similar project post-mortems

## 4. Business Viability (Does this work for our business?)

**Key Questions:**
- Does this align with business strategy and priorities?
- What's the revenue model and path to profitability?
- Can we support, maintain, and evolve this long-term?
- What are the opportunity costs vs other initiatives?

**Red Flags:**
- Unclear monetization path
- High ongoing operational costs
- Distracts from core business
- Success requires changing our business model

**Evidence Needed:**
- Financial model with sensitivity analysis
- Strategic alignment review
- Resource and support cost projections
- Market sizing and TAM analysis

## Scoring Guidelines

For each dimension, assess as:
- **Strong**: Clear evidence of success; low risk
- **Moderate**: Some evidence; manageable risks with mitigation
- **Weak**: Little evidence; high risk or major gaps
- **Unknown**: Insufficient information to assess

**Overall Recommendation:**
- **Build**: All dimensions strong or moderate; clear path forward
- **Investigate**: One or more weak areas; need evidence before deciding
- **Pivot**: Fundamental issues; need to reframe problem or solution
- **Kill**: Fatal flaws; pursue other opportunities
